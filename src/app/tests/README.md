# TESTS
This directory contains all test realated files (unit, end-to-end, etc).

**Important Notes**
This application is using Jest and Vue test utils for unit testing.
Global jest config must be set under config directory.
Add only 'global mock data' to test-common-mock-data.js.
Module or component mock data must be stored on their respected directory.
You can add new test utils on test-common-utils.js but make sure to add a comment on your new utility.
